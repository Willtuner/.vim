# han-vim
My vim config

## Installation
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ko-han/han-vim/master/han-vim.sh)"
```
This will automatic open vim and run `:PlugInstall`. Maybe some error will occur at first time.  
After PlugInstall finished, close vim. Everything is fine now.
